# Determinism and Identity

All IDs and digests derive from bound content. Wall-clock time is not an identity input. JSON and JSONL ordering is stable.

## Delivery artifacts

- `registry/legacy_context_migration/setup_package_migrations/SETUPMIGRATION_8F5CED333AA143A8F2A798BA01D550D9`
- `LCM_09B_FILE_INDEX.txt`
- `LCM_09B_FILE_HASHES.sha256`
- `LCM_09B_QA_REPORT.json`


## Invariants

- No Setup semantics are inferred from filenames or static token counts.
- UNKNOWN and BLOCKED remain non-compensatory.
- Context semantics are read-only.
- Treatment, order and capital authority remain outside this phase.
