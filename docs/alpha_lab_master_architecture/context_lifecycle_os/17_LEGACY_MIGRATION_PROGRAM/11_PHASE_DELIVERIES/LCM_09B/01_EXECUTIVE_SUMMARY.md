# Executive Summary

Migration `SETUPMIGRATION_8F5CED333AA143A8F2A798BA01D550D9` closes LCM-09 without inventing missing Setup semantics. It accounts for 60 identities through 60 canonical fail-closed reference packages and 60 read-only Factory registrations.

## Delivery artifacts

- `registry/legacy_context_migration/setup_package_migrations/SETUPMIGRATION_8F5CED333AA143A8F2A798BA01D550D9`
- `LCM_09B_FILE_INDEX.txt`
- `LCM_09B_FILE_HASHES.sha256`
- `LCM_09B_QA_REPORT.json`


## Invariants

- No Setup semantics are inferred from filenames or static token counts.
- UNKNOWN and BLOCKED remain non-compensatory.
- Context semantics are read-only.
- Treatment, order and capital authority remain outside this phase.
