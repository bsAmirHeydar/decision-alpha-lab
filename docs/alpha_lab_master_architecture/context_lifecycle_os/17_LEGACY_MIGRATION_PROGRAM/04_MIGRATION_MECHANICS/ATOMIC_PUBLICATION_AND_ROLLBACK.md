# Atomic Publication and Rollback

The reference package is built in a private staging directory, verified, manifested and atomically renamed into its content-derived framework root. Existing destinations are never overwritten. Failure discards staging and leaves upstream state unchanged.

Rollback removes only LCM-06 additions and returns to the exact LCM-05 topology state. No prose-based reconstruction is permitted.

## Evidence

- Framework run: `FRAMEWORK_066C5FA5795AA4C283B17271E4478751`
- Upstream topology: `TOPOLOGY_F28766C555330F0B89CC662DA8129220`
- Acceptance state: `REFERENCE_FRAMEWORK_ACCEPTED_NO_MIGRATION_EXECUTED`

## Non-claims

No source move, deletion, target materialization, semantic refactor, merge, cutover, runtime authority, order authority or capital authority is introduced.
