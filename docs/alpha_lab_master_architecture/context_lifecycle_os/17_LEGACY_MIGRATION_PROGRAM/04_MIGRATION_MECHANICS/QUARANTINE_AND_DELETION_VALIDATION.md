# Quarantine and Deletion Validation

Quarantine readiness requires preserved source, manifest, hash, replacement map, parity report, rollback plan and zero active consumers. Deletion requires every non-compensatory deletion gate, including owner approval, independent review, quarantine period, rollback tag and clean-clone verification.

Even when all gates pass, automatic deletion remains forbidden. Human execution authority and a dedicated delete commit are still required.

## Evidence

- Framework run: `FRAMEWORK_066C5FA5795AA4C283B17271E4478751`
- Upstream topology: `TOPOLOGY_F28766C555330F0B89CC662DA8129220`
- Acceptance state: `REFERENCE_FRAMEWORK_ACCEPTED_NO_MIGRATION_EXECUTED`

## Non-claims

No source move, deletion, target materialization, semantic refactor, merge, cutover, runtime authority, order authority or capital authority is introduced.
