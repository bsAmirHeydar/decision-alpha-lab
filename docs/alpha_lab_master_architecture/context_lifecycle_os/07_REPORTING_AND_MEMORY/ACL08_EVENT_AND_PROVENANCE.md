# Acl08 Event And Provenance

Records seven hash-linked events and a graph reaching ACL-07 validation while proving decisions were not mutated.

## Invariants

- Exact identities and digests resolve.
- UNKNOWN remains explicit.
- Diagnostic evidence remains segregated.
- Generated content is immutable and replayable.
- Promotion, order and capital authority remain false.

## Failure behavior

Any missing identity, schema mismatch, policy drift, authority escalation or integrity failure stops publication.
