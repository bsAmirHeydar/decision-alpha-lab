# Acl08 Authority Model

Accepts only `ACL08_BUILD_REPORT_AND_EXPERIENCE`. Network, secrets, promotion, order submission and capital activation remain denied.

## Invariants

- Exact identities and digests resolve.
- UNKNOWN remains explicit.
- Diagnostic evidence remains segregated.
- Generated content is immutable and replayable.
- Promotion, order and capital authority remain false.

## Failure behavior

Any missing identity, schema mismatch, policy drift, authority escalation or integrity failure stops publication.
