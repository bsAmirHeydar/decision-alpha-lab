# Acl08 Failure Taxonomy

Integrity mismatch, policy denial, authority failure, redaction leak, schema error and publication conflict all fail closed with no permissive fallback.

## Invariants

- Exact identities and digests resolve.
- UNKNOWN remains explicit.
- Diagnostic evidence remains segregated.
- Generated content is immutable and replayable.
- Promotion, order and capital authority remain false.

## Failure behavior

Any missing identity, schema mismatch, policy drift, authority escalation or integrity failure stops publication.
