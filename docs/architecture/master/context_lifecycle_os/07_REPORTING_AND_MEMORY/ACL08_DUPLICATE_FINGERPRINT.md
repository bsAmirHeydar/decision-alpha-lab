# Acl08 Duplicate Fingerprint

Hashes decision class, reason codes and gate-status vector to help ACL-09 identify exact semantic repeats without relying on filenames.

## Invariants

- Exact identities and digests resolve.
- UNKNOWN remains explicit.
- Diagnostic evidence remains segregated.
- Generated content is immutable and replayable.
- Promotion, order and capital authority remain false.

## Failure behavior

Any missing identity, schema mismatch, policy drift, authority escalation or integrity failure stops publication.
