# Move-Only and Redirect Preview

Move-only tooling emits deterministic `git mv` plans containing source path, target path and source digest. It explicitly denies semantic edits, execution and target materialization. Redirect tooling emits preview content for MQL include wrappers, Obsidian redirect notes and Python import shims.

Preview generation never writes to legacy source paths. Actual move, redirect and refactor commits remain separate review units.

## Evidence

- Framework run: `FRAMEWORK_066C5FA5795AA4C283B17271E4478751`
- Upstream topology: `TOPOLOGY_F28766C555330F0B89CC662DA8129220`
- Acceptance state: `REFERENCE_FRAMEWORK_ACCEPTED_NO_MIGRATION_EXECUTED`

## Non-claims

No source move, deletion, target materialization, semantic refactor, merge, cutover, runtime authority, order authority or capital authority is introduced.
