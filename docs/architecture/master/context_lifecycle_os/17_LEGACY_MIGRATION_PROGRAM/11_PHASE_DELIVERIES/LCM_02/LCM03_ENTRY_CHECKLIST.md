# LCM-03 Entry Checklist

Require exact handoff digest, classification records, owner registry, unresolved queues, security isolation and protected-platform report.

## Invariants

- UNKNOWN is blocking.
- Classification is not semantic approval.
- No move, delete, refactor, merge, cutover, runtime, order or capital authority is created.

## Verification

The machine package, closed registries, tests and output manifest must preserve these statements exactly.
