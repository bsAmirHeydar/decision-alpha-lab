# Operations Runbook

Verify package, installation, compile Python, run LCM-02, LCM-01, LCM-00 and ACL-15 tests, stage exact index, commit and push.

## Invariants

- UNKNOWN is blocking.
- Classification is not semantic approval.
- No move, delete, refactor, merge, cutover, runtime, order or capital authority is created.

## Verification

The machine package, closed registries, tests and output manifest must preserve these statements exactly.
