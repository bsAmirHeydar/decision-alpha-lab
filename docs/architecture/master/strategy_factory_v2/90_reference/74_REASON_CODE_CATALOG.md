# Purpose

Canonical machine-readable reasons for trade, skip, abstain, reject, and failure.

# Responsibilities

Groups include context, gate, candidate, model, threshold, latency, risk, broker, lifecycle, duplicate, and internal error. Codes are stable; detail goes in diagnostics.

# Fast-path constraints

- All authoritative inputs must be available at the declared decision time.
- Work must be bounded by the compiled plan.
- Runtime failures must map to explicit abstention or rejection reason codes.
- No module may silently change strategy canon, model schema, thresholds, or capital limits.

# Forbidden coupling and failure modes

Arbitrary free text used as logic.

# Required tests

Every decision path emits one primary and optional secondary codes.

# Operational completion criteria

1. The module has a versioned contract and owner.
2. Inputs, outputs, timestamps, units, and missing behavior are explicit.
3. Deterministic replay is possible from stored artifacts.
4. Performance is benchmarked under the intended mode.
5. Failure behavior is fail-closed when the module is authoritative.
6. Migration and rollback are documented.
