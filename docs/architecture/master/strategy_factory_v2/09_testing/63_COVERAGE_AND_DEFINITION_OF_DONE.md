# Purpose

Defines completion by risk and behavior rather than raw line coverage.

# Responsibilities

Every invariant, error path, reason code, lifecycle transition, candidate policy, and critical timestamp boundary has evidence. Coverage combines code, contract, scenario, mutation, and replay dimensions.

# Fast-path constraints

- All authoritative inputs must be available at the declared decision time.
- Work must be bounded by the compiled plan.
- Runtime failures must map to explicit abstention or rejection reason codes.
- No module may silently change strategy canon, model schema, thresholds, or capital limits.

# Forbidden coupling and failure modes

Chasing 100 percent line coverage while critical semantics remain untested.

# Required tests

A module is done only when its failure modes and operational runbook exist.

# Operational completion criteria

1. The module has a versioned contract and owner.
2. Inputs, outputs, timestamps, units, and missing behavior are explicit.
3. Deterministic replay is possible from stored artifacts.
4. Performance is benchmarked under the intended mode.
5. Failure behavior is fail-closed when the module is authoritative.
6. Migration and rollback are documented.
