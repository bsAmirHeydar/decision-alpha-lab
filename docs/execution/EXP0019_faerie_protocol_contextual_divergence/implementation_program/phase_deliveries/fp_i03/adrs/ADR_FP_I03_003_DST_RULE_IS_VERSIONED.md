# DST Rule Is Versioned

## Status

Accepted.

## Decision

Use FP-NY-US-DST-2007PLUS@1.0.0 for 2007–2099 and fail outside the range.

## Rationale

Time law is behavior. Silent extrapolation would contaminate every downstream identity.

## Consequences

- The rule is included in semantic configuration or registry identity.
- Python and MQL5 mirrors must produce compatible boundary facts.
- Golden fixtures and negative tests enforce the decision.
- A change requires a new version and downstream rebaseline.

## Rejected alternatives

- Inferring behavior from broker or chart state.
- Using inclusive end boundaries.
- Repairing ambiguous or missing civil values silently.
- Treating documented time rules as projection-only settings.

## Verification

- Unit and boundary tests.
- Golden vector hash.
- MQL5 static/self-test evidence.
- Delivery validator and exact file inventory.
