# V4-06 Treatment DSL Handoff

## Purpose

The handoff provides exact graph, package, registry, policy, node, edge, and integrity identities to V4-06. V4-06 may bind an externally governed finite Treatment DSL to graph-readable Context representation. It may not mutate the graph, infer authority, generate an unbounded action space, train a model, select a Treatment, allocate risk, activate runtime, or send an order merely because the handoff exists.

## Contractual rules

1. Inputs are immutable, exact-versioned, content-addressed, point-in-time correct, and bound to one Evidence Role.
2. Unknown, stale, unsupported, hash-mismatched, cross-role, over-budget, or authority-violating states fail closed.
3. Operational ordering, request IDs, cache locations, process IDs, and runtime scheduling are not semantic inputs.
4. Every accepted output is reconstructible from the source package hash, registry hash, policy hash, temporal boundaries, and code version.
5. UCEE remains authority of record; this phase grants no training, Treatment selection, portfolio, runtime, broker, or order authority.

## Implementation evidence

The reference implementation is located in `lab/11_strategy_factory/python/saed_v4_semantic_hypergraph`. Closed contracts are in `lab/11_strategy_factory/schemas/saed_v4_05`; examples and negative fixtures are in `lab/11_strategy_factory/examples/saed_v4_05`; tests are in `lab/11_strategy_factory/tests/phase_saed_v4_05_semantic_temporal_hypergraph`; and the diagnostic-only MQL5 mirror is in `mql5/Include/AlphaLab/StrategyFactory/SAEDV4SemanticHypergraph`.

## Failure posture

There is no silent repair. Invalid source identity, future visibility, cross-role evidence, unknown relation type, invalid arity, dangling incidence, duplicate identity, hash mismatch, exceeded capacity, or forbidden authority produces rejection or quarantine. External evidence that is unavailable remains explicitly pending.
